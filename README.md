This project mixes the code from 
 - Wallet [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
 - Responsive menu / site framework taught in this tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D31P9ovJjqs
 - Responsive body from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0a7PEOi0do
    
I created this temaplate because I'm not really a front-end guy, but I find myself often needing 
a simple responsive site template that has rainbowkit support built in. This way I don't need to go
search for a tutorial every time I want to remember the exact syntax for media-query or something. 

Default colors can be specified in styles/variables.scss. I went full on Roy G. Biv in picking 
my defaults because, well, it is rainbowkit ... but also because I wanted people to be forced to think 
about colors when starting a project. Colors evoke emotion, they evoke feeling, they can help put 
you in the same mindset as your app's eventual users. Just because you're coding the backend, 
doesn't mean you don't need to understand user behavior. So take some time, search for some
color palettes online, let color put you in the mood, then start building.

Plus ... pretty colors are just way more fun to look at than black, white and grey. Who wants
to stare at that all day? It's like painting your walls white ... why live in a home with white
walls, when you could paint them pink, yellow and blue?

Plus ... it's pride month, so what could be more fitting.

Very little code here is actually mine, it's mostly from the links specified above. I feel like
I'm more like an editor and less like a coder on this project.
